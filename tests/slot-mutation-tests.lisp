;;;; The slot-mutation contract (GH #135): which node a transaction may write.
;;;;
;;;; EVERY test here closes and reopens the graph.  In-session reads are served
;;;; by the node cache, so a write/read in one image passes against a graph that
;;;; is being destroyed -- that is why #135 survived the rest of the suite.
